# Stock Market App
Welcome to the Stock Market App. This is a project from YouTube by (Philipp Lackner)[https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner].
The purpose of this project is learning new concepts and be confident with Jetpack Compose and this could be the "last version" because we know Android is always changing.

## Set up
I define a "started" branch to set up the project, if you want to practice just clone the project and switch the branch to "started" or follow theses steps in your Android Studio:

- File > New > Project from Version Control
- In the URL field put the URL of this repository: https://github.com/JGaldo-beep/Stock-Market-App/ (without "tree/started") 
- Clone
- Go to the "build.gradle.kts (Module)" and click "Sync now"

Now you're ready to start!
