# Stock Market App
Welcome to the Stock Market App. This is a project from YouTube by [Philipp Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner).
The purpose of this project is learning new concepts and be confident with Jetpack Compose and this could be recently version (01/06/2024) because we know Android is always changing (Dependencies version as well).

## Set up
I define a "started" branch to set up the project, if you want to practice just clone the project and switch the branch to "started" or follow theses steps in your Android Studio:

- File > New > Project from Version Control
- In the URL field put the URL of this repository: https://github.com/JGaldo-beep/Stock-Market-App/ (without "tree/started") 
- Clone
- Go to the "build.gradle.kts (Module)" and click "Sync now"

Now you're ready to start!

Note: Learning goes beyond copying. If you're serious about expanding your knowledge, I highly recommend following this video. Phill does a fantastic job explaining the app and the principles of clean architecture. As you build more apps, you'll gain the confidence to tackle complex projects on your own. Keep going!
